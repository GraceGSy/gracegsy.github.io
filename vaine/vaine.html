				<p style="margin-top:0px">Natural experiments are observational studies where the assignment of treatment conditions to different populations occurs by chance "in the wild". Researchers from fields such as economics, healthcare, and the social sciences leverage natural experiments to conduct hypothesis testing and causal effect estimation for treatment and outcome variables that would otherwise be costly, infeasible, or unethical. In this paper, we introduce VAINE (Visualization and AI for Natural Experiments), a visual analytics tool for identifying and understanding natural experiments from observational data. We then demonstrate how VAINE can be used to validate causal relationships, estimate average treatment effects, and identify statistical phenomena such as Simpson's paradox through two usage scenarios.</p>

					The work of citizen scientists has been invaluable for gathering and monitoring environmental data over time. In recent years, a variety of digital technologies have been developed in order to facilitate such work, making it easier for more people to engage in citizen science activities.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					Biological monitoring of macroinvertebrates in freshwater ecosystems is one area in which reliably, high-quality data gathered by citizen scientists yields critical information about the water quality and health of these ecosystems. The online educational resource <a href="http://macroinvertebrates.org/#/">macroinvertebrates.org</a> was thus envisioned to help train citizen scientists in data collection, using high-resolution gigapixel images of macroinvertebrates and supplemental media to <b>improve volunteer engagement, accuracy and confidence</b>.
				</p>
				<div class="container">

						<p class="imageText">macroinvertebrates.org is an online educational resource developed for training citizen scientists to identify freshwater macroinvertebrates.</p>

				</div>

				<p class="paragraph">
					The goal of an online educational resource for training citizen scientists is not to turn these volunteers into professional entomologists. However, part of what makes professional entomologists experts in their field is their ability to apply a variety of strategies to make an accurate identification. <b>A successful learning tool should help these citizen scientists acquire the expert strategies needed to generate reliable data</b>.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">
					It is thus necessary to <b>identify, visualize and articulate these expert strategies</b> to stakeholders involved in the design of this online learning tool. To that end, SEE was developed to facilitate communicate across disciplines about the kinds of expert strategies the educational platform should support.
				</p>

				<p class="paragraph">1. The initial model of visualization is called Play-by-Play. This is a linear recreation of an identification process, breaking it down into separate steps. Each step is considered a shift between resources (e.g. look at specimen, look at key, look back at specimen). Although it is possible to look at a Play-by-Play visualization and get a general sense for patterns of steps and ease of identification, it is hard to intuit the strategies used and obstacles encountered. Nonetheless, the Play-by-Play is a useful initial model that can be translated into other, clearer representations.

				</div>
				<br />
				<p class="paragraph">2. The matrix model compares the resources used (vertical) against the information sought (horizontal). This model is ideal for identifying frequently used resources, but provides little information about the actual process.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">3. SEE incorporates the strengths of the above two models. Steps taken towards an identification are represented as moves downwards while changes in strategy (such as looking at a figure when unsure about terms in the text) are represented as moves toward the right.
				</p>
				<p class="paragraph">The SEE model makes it clear at a glance where experts struggled and the kinds of strategies they had to adopt before making a definite move downwards. This provides information about the kinds of strategic practices the website could or should have supported. It can thus be used as a grounding point for design decisions about the features that would help novices making an identification.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="partfour">
				<p class="paragraph">The first visualization below is the process taken by an expert who has not done macroinvertebrate identification in years. It can be seen that there are many places where she observes the necessary features rapidly and moves downwards in terms of ID progression. However, there are places where she was uncertain about what she was seeing, and thus had to employ many strategy shifts sideways.</p>
				<p>Notably, she made a guess at one point. Following that guess, the first ID she arrived at did not make sense to her because the location was outside where the specimen was collected, she then knew to return to where she struggled and took a second look to correct her mistake.</p>
				<img class="image" src="images/201 Vis 2.png" style="border: solid 1px #d3d3d3">
				<br />
				<p class="paragraph">Comparatively the second and third experts below have both been doing macroinvertebrate identification for years. This is clear from the relatively shorter length of their SEE visualizations. It is also worth noting that most of their steps were downwards towards an identification, suggesting that they had little trouble looking for the  diagnostic features. In fact, expert 3 was able to identify the specimen almost at a glance.</p>
